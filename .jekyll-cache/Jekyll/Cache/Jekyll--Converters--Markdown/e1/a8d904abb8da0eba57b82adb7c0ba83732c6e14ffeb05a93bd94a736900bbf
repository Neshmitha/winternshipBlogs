  <li><strong>What is the missing semester all about?</strong><br />
The missing semester is a student driven initiative to conduct lecture sessions by inviting experts to handle topics of interest to freshers. Learning is at its best when we dont earmark your progress with marks and grades. Missing semester is an attmept to teach some of the great ideas in computer science the fun way.This also acts as a confidence booster for many students as they get to connect one on one with professors and some of the dedicated senior students.</li>
  <li><strong>What will you be covering as part of the MS?</strong><br />
We will start with some of the essential conceptual and computatinal toolkits for freshers and move ahead teaching prominent ideas in computer science.</li>
  <li><strong>I wont be able to attend the classes? Can I skip the upcoming class and show up on the next one?</strong><br />
There is good demand for this course from students in and outside our branch. We would like to give preference for students who are sincerely attending the sessions. Our mentors will keep a note on who is attending and who isnâ€™t. Keep your mentor informed at all times. Also note that there is a threshold of the number of students a mentor can help. If a student is consistently missing the sessions, the mentor will replace him/her with a new student.</li>
  <li><strong>I am finding it hectic to attend the sessions. Should I drop coming to the MS?</strong><br />
We strongly suggest that you drop coming to the sessions if you are finding your semester hectic. This is mainly meant to supplmenet your learning and will not provide you with any extra credits.</li>
  <li><strong>What if I am from a different branch other than CSE/AI. Can I attend the sessions?</strong><br />
We are currently limiting the MS sessions to the CS/AI students only. We will soon open it for the other branches. We will keep you all posted.</li>
  <li><strong>I am finding some of the sessions fast paced. How do I keep up?</strong><br />
Your one point contact is your mentor, please talk to your mentor individually and understand what needs to be done in order to keep in pace with the sessions.</li>
